# regen-job-board

I need a modern, sleek job board for my new website RegenAgWork.com
The site is a very simple job board for all things in the various regenerative ag niches (No till, adaptive grazing, compost, etc)

I also have a website I want you to copy the layout from, which is https://japan-dev.com/
